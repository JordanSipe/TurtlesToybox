    <p>
      Turtle's Toybox is a non-profit organization that takes in new and gently-loved
      toys and clothes, and gives them to families that have been affected by disasters
      such as fires, floods, ETC. <br>

      of Angel Davis (Aunt), John Davis (Father), and Cathy Dietrich (Grandmother). <br>

    <p>
      Crystal has single handedly collected most of the donations for "her children" that
      have lost their toys and feel lost throught disaster. Crystal (nickname Turtle) has
      donated to many organizations and institutions including Erie Shriner's Children's
      Hospital, Women's Mercy Center, Emmaus Soup Kitchen, Ms. Clara's Neighborhood Center
      (seen on Extreme Home makeover) and donated her time to this project. <br>
